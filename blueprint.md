# Project Blueprint: Mangalam WiFi Zone

## Goal
The primary goal is to publish the existing local code to a new public repository on GitHub.

## Current Status
- A local Git repository has been successfully initialized.
- All project files have been committed.
- The remote `origin` is configured to point to `https://github.com/Mangalamkol/Mangalam-WiFi-Zone.git`.

## Blocker
All attempts to push the code have failed with the following error:
```
fatal: repository 'https://github.com/Mangalamkol/Mangalam-WiFi-Zone.git/' not found
```
**This error is definitive. It means the repository does not exist on GitHub.**

## **Required Next Step**

The repository **must be created on GitHub.com** before we can push the code to it.

### Instructions:
1.  **Go to this URL:** [https://github.com/new](https://github.com/new)
2.  For "Repository name", enter exactly: `Mangalam-WiFi-Zone`
3.  Set the repository to **Public**.
4.  **Do not** add a README, .gitignore, or license file.
5.  Click the **"Create repository"** button.

Once you have completed this single step, please inform me, and the `git push` command will finally succeed.
